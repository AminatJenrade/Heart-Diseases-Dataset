# Heart-Diseases-Dataset
# This project is about preprocessing a heart disease data.
# I was able to plot a graph showing the heatmap, visualize the data, splitting the data into X and Y and then future scaling the X.
# Train, test them
# Random forest classifier was also used to model the heart disease dataset
